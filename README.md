### Changes I would have made

1.  I would have fixed the questionaire completed and answer display area.
1.  I would have had the final screen render a list of answers alongside the questions so the user knew what they had responded with. I began this but small errors will stop the screen from working.
1.  I would have implemented the "Next Question" key allowing dynamic movement between questions via the ID.
1.  I would have persisted the answers within the inputs so that moving forwards and backwards kept the data.
1.  I would have added styling.
