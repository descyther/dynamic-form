### Changes I would have made

1.  I would have fixed the questionaire completed and answer display area.
2.  Had the final screen render a list of answers alongside the questions so the user knew what they had responded with. I began this but small errors will stop the screen from working.
3.  Implemented the "Next Question" key allowing dynamic movement between questions via the ID.
4.  Persisted the answers within the inputs so that moving forwards and backwards kept the data.
5. I would have added more variables rather than logic within the JSX.
6. Added the ability to update an answer when moving backwards
7. I would have added styling for positioning and a colour for the error text
